Text Editor Tutorial ToDos:
 1. Remove abuf struct and find solution with less realloc (or ideally 0)
 2. separate command mode and input mode
 3. Implement piece table instead of array for rows
 4. Fix status bar implementation
 5. (lowest priority)
    Look at the write to file sequence and see if there is a better way of writing with non-blocking techniques, or at least ways
    of reducing write times by reducing time spent in the blocked state (can we interleave writes?)

    also make it so writing to an unchanged file is non-blocking 
 6. Syntax highlighting
 7. Searching
 8. Keybind for jumping to top/bot of file, end of line, start of line, ctrl+r/l to jump by spaces
